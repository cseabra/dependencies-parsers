# Installation

#### NodeJS / NPM:

Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm.

NPM makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code that you're sharing.

Once you ready with NodeJS/NPM, use this code in your terminal line command:

```
source 'git@nanananana.in.dst.nanana.com:component/Specs.git'

npm install
```

# Requirements
